				<h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
				<p>What are you trying to accomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>In this experiment, I aimed to create a chatbot that dynamically changes its tone—such as shifting to a poetic style—based on user input. The chatbot uses a grammar-based system to generate creative responses and incorporates dynamic visuals like background colors and shapes that change depending on the tone of the conversation. The goal was to combine technical elements like tone detection and response generation with creative visuals to create an engaging and interactive user experience.

				<h2><strong>Technical</strong></h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I built a chatbot using p5.js that detects the tone of user input (e.g., playful, poetic, or neutral) based on specific keywords. The bot uses predefined grammar templates to generate responses tailored to the detected tone. For example, if the user mentions words like "dream" or "heart," the bot shifts to a poetic tone and generates responses like, "In the realm of {topic}, dreams take flight."

				<h2><strong>Reflection</strong></h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p><strong>Reflection:</strong> The process of creating the poetry tone-changing chatbot in p5.js was quite frustrating. My goal was to build a chatbot that could dynamically change its tone, like shifting to a poetic style based on user input, while also incorporating creative visuals like dynamic background colors and shapes. However, I found the process harder and trickier than I initially thought it would be.

					Adjusting the grammar-based response system to feel natural and creative was another challenge. I wanted the bot's poetic responses to feel more meaningful, but it did not work out that well since I cannot exactly determine what the user will input. 
					
					Despite all this, I managed to create a chatbot that changes its tone and visuals based on user input. However, I didn’t enjoy the process as much as I hoped. Debugging the tone detection felt tedious at times, and I often found myself stuck on small details that disrupted the flow of the project for me.
					
					In the end, the final result is a chatbot that can shift into a poetic tone and adapts visuals semi well as well. While I’m proud of what I accomplished, the process taught me that blending technical and creative elements can be trickier than it really seems, because as first I thought I could create what I envisioned better but it was harder than I thought. It deepened my understanding of tone detection and response generation, but it also reminded me of the importance of patience, as well as persistence when working on coding projects.
