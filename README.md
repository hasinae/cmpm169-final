Project Title: Repatriation of Artifacts - Restoring Cultural Brilliance

Project Description: This interactive project explores the concept of repatriation by visually
demonstrating the transformation of artifacts when they are returned to their homeland. Artifacts
appear in dull tones in Western museums to symbolize detachment from their cultural origins,
but glow with vibrant colors when restored to their native lands, symbolizing cultural and
historical significance. Users engage with these transformations through interactive visuals,
encouraging reflection on cultural ownership and museum practices.
